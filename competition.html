			    <h2>Options</h2>
			    <hr>
			    <p>We initially searched for competitions in early September. Information on competitions was scant, and we didn't want to fully commit until more options came out. Many results were for competitions that already ended or were outside of the country. We noted that most of the preceding micromouse senior projects have participated in various IEEE regional competitions, but we couldn't find information on any happening in 2025 at the time.</p>
			    <p><a href="https://apec-conf.org/">APEC 2025</a> had the most information online, was located inside the United States, and had a concrete date for the competition. During the fall semester, we operated as if we were competing in APEC, as it was the closest thing we had to a concrete deadline for the project. We didn't register for the event, as we wanted to keep our options open.</p>
				<p>We found information on an IEEE regional competition near us in January, close to the deadline for APEC's early bird registration. We committed to the IEEE competition due to th cheaper costs and closer location.</p>
