				<hr>
				<p>As of the time of writing (2024-09-09), information on competitions being held in 2025 is scant, and nothing is confirmed until we are actually entered in a competition. However, we have options for competitions to partake in.</p>

			    <hr>
			    <p><a href="https://apec-conf.org/">APEC 2025</a> has the most information online, and a concrete date for the competition. We are unable to fully commit at this point in time, as registration opens in October.</p>
				<p>It seems that most of the preceding micromouse projects have participated in various IEEE regional competitions. It seems to be an annual event, even if nothing's been announced for 2025 as of now. If more information comes out, we will take it into account.</p>
