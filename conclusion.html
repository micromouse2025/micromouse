				<h2>Competition Results</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Despite our best efforts, out micromouse was unable to complete the maze on the day of the competition. Multiple factors contributed to this, which will be detailed below. Of important note is that the robot was able to complete the 8x8 test maze provided the night before the competition, with a few difficulties.</p>

				<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>While we do not have the time or budget to fix out design and enter in another competition, we are aware that other students will be designing their own robots for this competition in the future. To that end, we will pass along a message, giving them advice on how to move forawrd with some aspects of the project that we struggled with. Even with a more self-contained senior project like this, communication is still important.</p>
				<p>A significant amount of our struggles were the result of not being entirely clear on what the previous projects had left behind of their test maze. We intend to leave a next year's students with an accurate assessment of the state of the test maze, with advice on how to improve it. During the compeition and surrounding conference, we encountered the person who 3D printed the test maze provided the night before the competition. We are also leaving his business card with next year's students, increasing the amount of options they have available.</p>
