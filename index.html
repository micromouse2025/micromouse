				<h2>Project Overview</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>This website is dedicated to the documentation of the creation of a micromouse, a small, autonomous, maze-solving robot. The project started in September 2024, and will run until spring of 2025, when the micromouse will perform in a competition. Information about the competition, micromouse, and team can be found in the links above.</p>

				<h2>Design Restrictions</h2>
				<hr>
				<h3>The Micromouse</h3>
				<p>The micromouse is not allowed to exceed 25cm x 25cm in size, must remain grounded at all times, and must not separate into parts while navigating the maze. It also cannot damage or navigate over the maze walls.</p>
				<h3>The Maze</h3>
				<p>The maze is a 16x16 grid of cells. These cells are 18 cm x 18 cm in area, and the maze's walls are 50mm high. The starting point and end goal are constant for all competitors. The layout of the maze is only revealed at the start of the competition itself, after final modifications to the mice are made. The micromouse has a limited amount of time to navigate the maze, but it is allowed multiple runs of the maze during this time to optimize its path.</p>
